# warning
Probably going to deprecate and delete this.  Checking out 
<https://github.com/felixge/node-dateformat>

This is a clone of Baron Schwartz's date format library.

I extracted the date-functions code, and have done some small things
so that I can use it via npm and node.

I also fixed a  tiny bug in the getWeekOfYear() code, and started
adding a few tests, beginning with the get week of year stuff that
broke for me.

I take no credit for the awesome formatting library.  That is all due
to Baron Schwartz.
